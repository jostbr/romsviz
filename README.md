# romsviz
Under development so a lot of features does not work! The NetcdfOut class in romsviz/ncout.py was developed first, has been tested quite a bit and should work fairly well. The same goes for romsviz/outvar.py. However, romsviz/romsviz.py is a mess at the moment and little works; advice not attempt to use it yet.
